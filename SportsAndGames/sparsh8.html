<p>A card game is any game using playing cards as the primary device with which the game is played, be they traditional or game-specific
. Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such as poker).
 A small number of card games played with traditional decks have formally standardized rules,
 but most are folk games whose rules vary by region, culture, and person.</p>

<p>Many games that are not generally placed in the family of card games do in fact use cards for some aspect of their gameplay.
 Similarly, some games that are placed in the card game genre involve a board. The distinction is that the gameplay of a card game primarily
 depends on the use of the cards by players (the board is simply a guide for scorekeeping or for card placement), while board games (the principal 
non-card game genre to use cards) generally focus on the players' positions on the board, and use the cards for some secondary purpose.</p>

<p>A card game is played with a deck or pack of playing cards which are identical in size and shape. Each card has two sides, the face and the back.
 Normally the backs of the cards are indistinguishable. The faces of the cards may all be unique, or there can be duplicates.
 The composition of a deck is known to each player. In some cases several decks are shuffled together to form a single pack or shoe.</p>

<p>The first playing cards appeared in the ninth century during Tang dynasty China.
 The first reference to the card game in world history dates no later than the 9th century,
 when the Collection of Miscellanea at Duyang, written by Tang Dynasty writer Su E, described Princess Tongchang (daughter of Emperor Yizong of Tang)
 playing the "leaf game" in 868 with members of the Wei clan (the family of the princess' husband).[2][3] The Song dynasty statesman and historian Ouyang Xiu
 has noted that paper playing cards arose in connection to an earlier development in the book format from scrolls to pages.[1] During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644),
 characters from popular novels such as the Water Margin were widely featured on the faces of playing cards.[1] A precise description of Chinese money playing cards
 (in four suits) survived from the 15th century. Mahjong tiles are a 19th-century invention based on three-suited money playing card decks, similar to the way in
 which Rummikub tiles were derived recently from modern Western playing cards.</p>
