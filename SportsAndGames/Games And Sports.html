A sports game is a video game that simulates the practice of sports
. Most sports have been recreated with a game, including team sports, track and field, extreme sports and combat sports. 
Some games emphasize actually playing the sport (such as the Madden NFL series),
 whilst others emphasize strategy and sport management (such as Championship Manager and Out of the Park Baseball).
 Some, such as Need for Speed, Arch Rivals and Punch-Out!!, satirize the sport for comic effect. 
This genre has been popular throughout the history of video games and is competitive, just like real-world sports
. A number of game series feature the names and characteristics of real teams and players, and are updated annually to reflect real-world changes.
Sports games involve physical and tactical challenges, and test the player's precision and accuracy.
 Most sports games attempt to model the athletic characteristics required by that sport, including speed, strength, acceleration, accuracy, and so on.
 As with their respective sports, these games take place in a stadium or arena with clear boundaries.
 Sports games often provide play-by-play and color commentary through the use of recorded audio.
