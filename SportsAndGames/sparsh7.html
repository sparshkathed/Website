<p>Snakes and Ladders is an ancient Indian board game regarded today as a worldwide classic.
 It is played between two or more players on a gameboard having numbered, gridded squares.
 A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. 
The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square),
Snakes and Ladders originated in India as part of a family of dice board games, that included Gyan chauper and pachisi (present-day Ludo and Parcheesi).
 The game made its way to England and was sold as "Snakes and Ladders", then the basic concept was introduced in the United States as Chutes and Ladders 
(an "improved new version of England's famous indoor sport"[3]) by game pioneer Milton Bradley in 1943.[4]</p>

<p>Gyan chauper/Jnan chauper (game of wisdom), the version associated with the Jain philosophy[5] encompassed the concepts like karma and Moksha.
The game was popular in ancient India by the name Moksha Patam. It was also associated with traditional Hindu philosophy contrasting karma and kama, or
 destiny and desire. It emphasized destiny, as opposed to games such as pachisi, which focused on life as a mixture of skill (free will[6]) and luck.</p>

<p> The underlying ideals of the game inspired a version introduced in Victorian England in 1892. The game has also been interpreted and used as a tool 
for teaching the effects of good deeds versus bad. The board was covered with symbolic images, the top featuring gods, angels, and majestic beings,
 while the rest of the board was covered with pictures of animals, flowers and people.[7] The ladders represented virtues such as generosity, faith, 
and humility, while the snakes represented vices such as lust, anger, murder, and theft. The morality lesson of the game was that a person can attain
 salvation (Moksha) through doing good, whereas by doing evil one will inherit rebirth to lower forms of life. The number of ladders was less than the
 number of snakes as a reminder that a path of good is much more difficult to tread than a path of sins. Presumably, reaching the last square (number 100)
 represented the attainment of Moksha (spiritual liberation). helped or hindered by ladders and snakes respectively.</p>

<p>The game is a simple race contest based on sheer luck, and is popular with young children.
 The historic version had root in morality lessons, where a player's progression up the board represented a life journey complicated by virtues 
(ladders) and vices (snakes). A commercial version with different morality lessons, Chutes and Ladders, is published by Milton Bradley.</p></font>
